            What I have learnt from my previous work
        </h1>
        <p>
            Sublime surrounds landscaping labourer: 2018-2020 <br>
            A important job to me in my formative teenage years where I learnt the value of hard work, the importance of being punctual 
            and how to professionally engage in the workforce with other workers as well as clients. I had the responsibility of often 
            running worksites and teaching other labourers where I believe was where I started learning the satisfaction of teaching others. <br>
            JG & Co Building and Carpentry - Apprenticeship: 2020-2021 <br>
            This job was the start of my working career outside of school, finishing Year 12 and going straight into an apprenticeship. 
            This was what led me into my teaching career, as I was not enjoying being an apprentice and had to re-evaluate my direction in 
            life, finding teaching was my passion and where I was was meant to be. <br>
            Liqourland Miranda - March 2021- June 2022 <br>
            Dan Murphys Engadine - June 2022 - November 2022 <br>
            Liqourland Kareela - November 2022 - Current <br>
            These 3 jobs have been casual sales assistant positions during my time at University and although they are just casual retail 
            positions, they mean alot to me and have developed and matured me as a person. I have been given alot of responsibility in 
            these jobs, often running the shops alone, managing profits of over $10 000 daily, counting money and in charge of opening and 
            closing the store. I have gained a lot of confidence in myself in these roles in terms of talking to hundreds of new people a 
            day and having to refuse customers under the influence and customers who cannot produce a form of ID. I also discovered my love 
            for talking to people, becoming close with customers that I see every day and striking up conversations with random customers, 
            especially ones who may struggle with addictions and who might not have had a real conversation in who knows how long, seeing 
            their day brighten and showing them that someone does care brings me alot of satisfaction. <br>
