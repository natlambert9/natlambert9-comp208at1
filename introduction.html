            <p> I am 21 years old, living and growing up in the Sutherland Shire. I love surfing, skating, travelling and woodwork often 
                building creative projects. A hobby of mine at the moment is buying old vans and transforming them into campervans to sell 
                and love seeing the buyers excited about my work and their future travels. I think I am a great role model as a man and 
                have alot of knowledge and lessons that I want to give to my students to see them develop.
                <br> <br>
                I was raised in a middle class family with married parents and 2 brothers. Both my parents are very hands-on, my dad 
                being an engineer and mum a landscape gardener. During my entire childhood, they were constantly doing renovations on 
                the house by themselves, meaning I was raised around tools. My teenage years were spend either at the beach or on the 
                tools as there was always a project happening. This meant I gained a proficient understanding of tools before anyone 
                else at school, I think I can credit my whole TAS journey to my dad.

        I think ultimately my motivation for becoming a TAS teacher is simply to help people, make students feel good about themselves 
        and make a difference in their lives. High school is hard, there are so many other factors happening at once on top of a stressful 
        workload that the majority of students have not learnt how to cope. If I can be the break from that and students look forward to 
        coming to my class where we can take a break from traditional learning, have fun while still learning a valuable skill. I believe 
        this can make a huge positive difference on students lives. The majority of my schooling years were spent believing that I wasn't 
        smart, as when I started high school, it felt like all the other students were levels ahead of me and I was continually getting bad 
        marks. For a few years, I was pretending that I wasn't intelligent so I didn't have to try and had an excuse for myself when I 
        received bad marks. It was only until I started doing TAS subjects in years 9 and 10 that I started to excel and find myself. 
        I was relieved because somehow I just got it. Through these subjects, I gained confidence in myself and understood how I learned 
        in a hands on way. I think, without realising it, this was the beginning of my desire to become a TAS teacher. I want to show my 
        students that even if they don't perform well in traditional subjects, that doesn't mean they are not intelligent. 
        <br> <br> It's all about not judging a fish on its ability to climb a tree. <br> <br> 
        In my senior years of school, I realised that I felt more fulfilled when I was helping my peers understand a concept rather than 
        when I understood it myself. Having passionate TAS teachers at my school allowed me to see this in practice and inspired me. 
        I realised this, but I never did anything with it. I left school with a carpentry apprenticeship and, after half a year, realising 
        that I wanted to go back to a learning environment and become a teacher, and TAS was an immediate and perfect fit. (I think this 
        is partly because my mum always said I should be a TAS teacher, and I didn't want her to be right.) My struggle to fit within the 
        standard teaching practices I encountered in high school has stimulated my motivation to not only become a teacher, but to do 
        better than my previous teachers and not neglect different students styles of learning, but to equitably cater for all students 
        learning styles to not only allow all students to learn and excel within the classroom but be the building blocks to provide them
        with lifelong skills, allow them to find what they love, and make a positive impact on their lives and wellbeing. Whilst promoting, 
        creativity, individuality and students creating projects that they can be proud of and take home to show.

            A really powerful video that I have watched countless times that made me feel confident in myself as a learner and now is 
            extremely inspirational to me as a future teacher
