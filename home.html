            <h2>Hello and welcome to my professional teaching home page</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Nathaniel Moore-Lambert, and I am a pre-service teacher from Cronulla, pursuing a career as a dedicated Technology 
                and Applied Studies teacher. I am in my fourth year of my course, Bachelor of Education (Secondary)/Bachelor of Arts (Technology)
                at Australian Catholic University, Strathfield. <br> <br> I discovered my passion for the industrial arts in high school, especially 
                in woodwork and graphics, my passion shines through in my projects and enthusiasm and I can't wait to invoke this same passion 
                into my future students. <br> <br> This website was created to provide you with an overview of my personal and professional development 
                as a teacher. <br> <br> Here you will find the confluence of my innovation, inspiration, knowledge, skills, and reflections that define 
                my teaching journey, philosophies, and plans in order to flourish as a teacher in contemporary Australian society.
